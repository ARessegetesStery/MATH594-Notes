# MATH 594 Algebra II Notes (2024 Winter)

This is (partly) scribed and reflected upon MATH 594 in 2024 Winter by [Prof. Mircea Mustaţă](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mmustata/) in University of Michigan. 

The reference is given as above, and I personally sincerely appreciate the kind instructions of the professor throughout the semester.
